# Antigravity Agent Rules

The user has designated `instruction.md` as the core rule set for this project.

## Core Directives
1. **Adhere to `instruction.md`**: For all Stack, Architecture, Security, and Code Style decisions.
2. **eGovFrame 5.0**: Strictly follow the eGovFrame 5.0 standards defined in the instruction file.
3. **No Legacy**: Avoid legacy patterns (XML configs, etc.) unless explicitly required by eGovFrame compatibility (and even then, prefer Java Config).
